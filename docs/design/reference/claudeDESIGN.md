# Claude — Style Reference
> Warm parchment printed artifact — ink on bone paper, clay as the only chromatic breath.

**Theme:** light

Claude presents a warm-paper editorial interface: off-white parchment canvas (#f8f8f6) replaces the usual cold-white SaaS backdrop, paired with a near-black warm charcoal (#121212) for typography that reads as ink on paper rather than pixels on glass. The system is deliberately monochrome — the only chromatic accent is clay orange (#d97757), used sparingly as a signature mark rather than a call-to-action flood. Typography is the hero: Anthropic Serif sets the emotional headlines (the rare serif in tech), Anthropic Sans carries everything else at restrained weights (400-580), creating a hierarchy through size and weight contrast rather than color. Surfaces are flat with generous corner radii (16-24px on cards, 8px on controls), minimal shadow, and hairline borders — the aesthetic of a printed document rather than a digital product.

## Colors

| Name | Value | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Bone Parchment | `#f8f8f6` | Page canvas, large background areas, nav bar, secondary cards |
| Paper White | `#ffffff` | Elevated card surfaces, primary content surfaces above the canvas |
| Soft Stone | `#efeeeb` | Nested card surfaces, subtle background variation, alternate section bands |
| Carbon Ink | `#121212` | Primary text, headings, icon fills — warm near-black rather than pure black |
| Graphite | `#373734` | Secondary headings, button text, nav text — softer than carbon |
| Ashen | `#7b7974` | Muted helper text, captions, fine print, disclaimer copy |
| Pebble | `#9c9a92` | Tertiary text, copyright, very low-priority labels |
| Mist | `#b7b7b5` | Hairline nav dividers, subtle border lines |
| Chalk | `#e7e6e1` | Decorative illustration fills, soft background tints |
| Obsidian | `#000000` | Footer background — only true black on the page |
| Clay | `#d97757` | Orange decorative accent for icons, marks, and small graphic details. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |

## Typography

### Anthropic Serif — Display and editorial headlines (Explore plans, Think fast build faster). The serif is the brand signature — rare in AI/tech product UI; here it signals thoughtfulness and editorial confidence rather than software utility.
- **Substitute:** Source Serif 4, Charter, Georgia
- **Weights:** 400
- **Sizes:** 24px, 30px
- **Line height:** 1.20-1.33
- **Letter spacing:** normal

### Anthropic Sans — All interface text: body copy, nav, buttons, cards, links, labels. Weight 580 is the heaviest; weight 400 dominates. The whisper-to-medium weight range creates hierarchy through contrast rather than heaviness — headlines don't shout at 800, they speak at 580.
- **Substitute:** Inter, IBM Plex Sans, system-ui
- **Weights:** 400, 500, 550, 580, 600
- **Sizes:** 11px, 12px, 14px, 15px, 16px, 24px
- **Line height:** 1.33-1.63
- **Letter spacing:** normal

### Type Scale

| Role | Size | Line Height | Letter Spacing |
|------|------|-------------|----------------|

## Components

### Filled Dark Button
**Role:** Primary call-to-action on light surfaces

Dark carbon fill (#121212 or near-black), warm white text (#f8f8f6 or #fff), 8px radius, 8px vertical / 20px horizontal padding, 15px Anthropic Sans weight 500. The warmth of the text color on dark fill (f8f8f6, not pure white) keeps the button from feeling like a generic dark UI element.

### Pill Navigation Button
**Role:** Top-level nav links in header bar

Transparent background, Graphite (#373734) text, no border, 8px radius, 15px sans weight 500. Sits on the Bone Parchment canvas (#f8f8f6) with generous horizontal padding. The nav bar is minimal — logo left, links centered or right, no heavy borders or fills.

### Pricing Tier Card
**Role:** Plan comparison card (Free, Pro, Max)

White (#ffffff) surface on Bone Parchment canvas, 24px radius, 32px padding all sides. Heading uses Anthropic Serif 24-30px. Price in Carbon Ink (#121212), description in Ashen (#7b7974). No shadow by default — a soft 4px 24px shadow at oklab warmth appears on hover or featured tiers. Hairline 1px border at #e7e6e1 optional.

### Feature Benefit Card
**Role:** Compact card for feature lists within a plan

Soft Stone (#efeeeb) or Paper White (#ffffff) surface, 16px radius, generous internal padding (24-32px). Checkmark icons in Carbon Ink, body text at 14px in Graphite. Flat — no shadow. Creates a layered paper effect against the canvas.

### Editorial Section Header
**Role:** Section title with the Anthropic Serif treatment

Anthropic Serif 30px weight 400, line-height 1.2, Carbon Ink (#121212). Followed immediately by a short Ashen (#7b7974) body sentence at 16px. Generous 64-80px margin-top from the previous section.

### Footer Band
**Role:** Dark site footer

Obsidian (#000000) background — the only true black on the page, creating a deliberate tonal break. Text in muted gray (#9c9a92), links in Pebble or lighter. Multi-column grid with product/resource/company groupings. Compact 14px sans throughout.

### Inline Link
**Role:** Text links within body copy

Color shifts between default (Graphite #373734) and hover (Carbon Ink #121212) with underline. No chromatic color — the system treats links as typography, not as colored emphasis. Transitions on color/background-color at 0.2s ease.

### Input Field
**Role:** Email input on sign-in and signup forms

Transparent or Paper White fill, 1px border at Pebble (#b7b7b5) or Mist, 8px radius, 14px sans. Focus ring uses the cds-focus-shadow pattern: inset page-color ring + outer accent ring + blue glow. No dramatic state color shift.

### FAQ Accordion Item
**Role:** Expandable question in FAQ section

Borderless or hairline divider between items, question text in Graphite (#373734) at 14-16px sans, body expands below in Carbon Ink (#121212). Anthropic Sans carries the entire interaction — no serif in the FAQ body. Generous 24px vertical padding per item.

### Clay Accent Mark
**Role:** Decorative brand flourish, not an interactive element

Small Clay orange (#d97757) marks — dots, ornaments, illustration accents — that serve as the single chromatic breath in an otherwise monochrome system. Never used for button fills or large backgrounds.

### Status Badge
**Role:** Small inline status indicators

8px radius, 11-12px sans weight 500, low-contrast background tint with Carbon Ink or Graphite text. Rarely chromatic — stays in the warm-gray family to match the editorial tone.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Bone Parchment (#f8f8f6) as the default page canvas — never pure white for large backgrounds.
- Set display headlines in Anthropic Serif weight 400 at 30px with line-height 1.2; let the serif do the work, not weight.
- Keep the palette monochrome — the only chromatic color is Clay (#d97757), reserved for decorative marks and editorial accents, never button fills.
- Use 24px radius for elevated cards and 16px for nested/secondary cards; 8px for all buttons, inputs, and nav controls.
- Maintain generous section spacing: 64-80px between major sections, 32px card padding, 8-12px between elements within a component.
- Pair Carbon Ink (#121212) text with Paper White (#ffffff) cards on Bone Parchment (#f8f8f6) for the layered paper effect.
- Reference warm grays (Graphite, Ashen, Pebble) for text hierarchy — never introduce a second chromatic for emphasis.

### Don't
- Don't introduce button fills in Clay orange or any chromatic color — actions stay dark on light or light on dark.
- Don't use pure black (#000000) for body text — Carbon Ink (#121212) is warmer and reads as ink, not void.
- Don't set headlines at weight 700+ — the system speaks at weight 580 max for sans and 400 for serif.
- Don't apply heavy shadows to cards — shadow appears only as a soft 4px 20-24px wash at low opacity, or not at all.
- Don't use cool blues or greens for accent or brand — the system is deliberately warm monochrome.
- Don't set large display headlines in Anthropic Sans — the serif is the signature, the sans is the utility.
- Don't add decorative gradients — the design rejects them in favor of flat, printed-paper surfaces.

## Elevation

- **Feature Card (hover state):** `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04) 0px 4px 20px 0px`
- **Pricing Tier Card (featured/hover):** `oklab(0.431435 -0.02915 -0.125723 / 0.1) 0px 4px 24px 0px`

## Surfaces

- **Page Canvas** (`#f8f8f6`) — Base background for all pages — warm off-white parchment
- **Card Surface** (`#ffffff`) — Primary content cards elevated above the canvas
- **Nested Surface** (`#efeeeb`) — Secondary cards or sub-sections within a card
- **Dark Band** (`#000000`) — Footer — only dark surface, creates deliberate tonal break

## Imagery

Imagery is sparse and editorial in tone. Product photography and illustrations appear full-bleed within hero or feature sections, treated with generous corner radii (16-24px) and no decorative borders. The Clay orange accent (#d97757) appears in select illustration details — hands, objects, ornamental marks — reinforcing the warm paper aesthetic. Icons are mono Carbon Ink, outlined or filled at consistent weight, never multicolor. The overall density is low: most sections are text-dominant with imagery appearing as punctuation rather than spectacle. No gradients, no glow effects, no 3D renders.

## Layout

Claude uses a max-width contained layout centered around 1200px on the Bone Parchment canvas. The hero pattern is a centered editorial headline in Anthropic Serif over generous whitespace, often paired with a full-bleed product image below the fold. Sections flow as alternating light bands — Bone Parchment canvas with white cards floating on it, occasional Soft Stone (#efeeeb) bands for visual rhythm. Content arrangement alternates between centered stacks (headlines, FAQs, CTAs) and asymmetric 2-column layouts (text-left/image-right feature blocks). Pricing uses a 3-column card grid (Free, Pro, Max) with elevated featured tier. Navigation is a minimal top bar: logo left, link cluster right, no heavy borders or fills. Vertical spacing is generous — 64-80px between sections, 32px within cards — creating a printed-page cadence rather than a dense product UI.

## Similar Brands

- **Stripe** — Same warm off-white canvas (#fbf9f6 territory), generous whitespace, flat card surfaces with soft radii, and restraint in using color — Stripe also keeps its palette nearly monochrome in marketing surfaces.
- **Linear** — Dark and light mode mastery with minimal chromatic accents, generous card radii (16-24px), and tight typographic hierarchy — though Linear skews darker while Claude skews warm-paper.
- **Notion** — Editorial restraint: monochrome palette, generous spacing, serif-optional typography that prioritizes readability over visual spectacle.
- **Arc Browser** — Warm-paper aesthetic with clay-adjacent accent palette, editorial typographic confidence, and a refusal to use typical SaaS blue as a brand color.
